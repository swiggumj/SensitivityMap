# Logical next steps...
- Incorporate pulse widths in FluxCalc
- Incorporate degradation due to avg. offset in FluxCalc
- Improve gridding technique (even 3D sky coverage, simple function with user-input resolution)
- Continue updating existing surveys and add older surveys
- Simulate populations to find Npsr(gl,gb) and DMmed(gl,gb)
- Equatorial/galactic plotting option
- Overplot PTA MSPs to explore under-populated sky positions
- Write function that generates sensitivity curves for a given survey
- Write function that mines psrcat for detectable sources (given survey)
- Look into coding "spectral sensitivity" (Manchester 2001)
- Explore sensitivity as f(P0) and f(DM) (make videos?)
- Incorporate everything into PsrPopPy
