# Logical next steps...
- [ ] Implement astropy functions to improve coordinate transformations/flexibility.
- [x] Implement healpy (skymap?) for more accurate gridding and better plotting capabilities.
- [ ] Incorporate pulse widths in FluxCalc
- [ ] Incorporate degradation due to avg. offset in FluxCalc
- [ ] Continue updating existing surveys and add older surveys
- [ ] Simulate populations to find Npsr(gl,gb) and DMmed(gl,gb)
- [ ] Equatorial/galactic plotting option (available w/ healpy?)
- [ ] Overplot PTA MSPs to explore under-populated sky positions
- [ ] Write function that generates sensitivity curves for a given survey
- [ ] Write function that mines psrcat for detectable sources (given survey)
- [ ] Look into coding "spectral sensitivity" (Manchester 2001)
- [ ] Explore sensitivity as f(P0) and f(DM) (make videos?)
- [ ] Incorporate everything into PsrPopPy
- [ ] Update code (Python3); relies on similar PsrPopPy compatibility.
- [ ] Run black (https://pypi.org/project/black/) to clean up code.
